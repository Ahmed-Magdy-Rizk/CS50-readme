#### Description:

My project is a web-based application using Flask. My web application is a simulation of an online banking system.

#### Project Files

4- deposit.html (it allows you to deposit money to your account)

10- apology (this is the failure template to demonstrate to the user what exactly they did wrong)

11- login (you should to type in your name and your password to loging)


##### 3- helpers.py
- the implementation of apology. ity renders a template, apology.html. It also happens to define within itself another function, escape, that it simply uses to replace special characters in apologies. By defining escape inside of apology, weâ€™ve scoped the former to the latter alone; no other functions will be able (or need) to call it.
- usd function, a short function that simply formats a float as USD (e.g., 10000 is formatted as $10,000.00).

##### 4-clints.db
- this data base contains two tables, first users and the second is ledger
